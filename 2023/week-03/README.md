# Tidytuesday - Week 3: Art Hisroty

TidyTuesday's week 3 of 2023 comes from the [arhistory data package](https://saralemus7.github.io/arthistory/), used for Holland Stam's thesis, [Quantifying art historical narratives](https://research.repository.duke.edu/concern/datasets/q811kk70n?locale=en). The dataset contains various information about artists through the editions of two of the most used art history textbooks in the American education System: Janson’s History of Art and Gardner’s Art Through the Ages.

I'll use the dataset to create some visuals about diversity in art across the years.

For the moment, I'll plot gender and race representation across the years
