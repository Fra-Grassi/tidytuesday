# Tidytuesday - Week 1: Bring your own data!

For the first Tidytuesday week of 2023 we bring our own data.  
I'm not going to do anything original here! I just stubled upon the beautiful plot by [RalitzaSoultanova](https://github.com/RalitzaSoultanova/TidyTuesday2023/tree/main/W1) and decided I could try to replicate it without looking at their code. **All credits for the idea to them!**

So the goal is to create a figure showing the number of steps I walked per day in 2022, as recorded from my iPhone and Apple Watch.
