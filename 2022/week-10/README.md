# Tidytuesday - Week 10: Erasmus Student Mobility

[Tidytuesday's Week 10](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-03-08/readme.md) is about **Eramusm Mobility Data**, from [Data.Europa](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets?locale=en&catalog=eac&query=erasmus&page=1&sort=issued%2Bdesc,%20relevance%2Bdesc,%20title.en%2Basc).

Dataset contains lots of data about mobility of Erasmus students in the period 2014 - 2019.

I'm going to use this dataset as an exercise to learn about **alluvial plots**.
