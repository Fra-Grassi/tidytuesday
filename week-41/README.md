# Tidytuesday - Week 41: Stranger Things Dialogue

This week's tidytuesday dataset is about dialogues from Stranger Things!  
This offers me an opportunity for some exercise in **text mining** and  **sentiment analysis**.

Since I'm pretty much new to the topic (just briefly played with it in the past) for this exercise I will follow along the very nice [Text Mining in R: A tidy Approach](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) by Julia Silge and David Robinson. I will start with the same kind of approach they use in the text, and maybe add something more original once I familiarize with the tools and the topic.

This is the plan for the moment (might grow while exploring the data)

- Prepare the data
- Some text mining:
  - Who talks the most in the series?
  - Who has the longest dialogue?
  - Who talks most with whom?
- Sentiment analysis:
  - Visualize the lexicon categories of the main characters
  - Which are the most common positive and negative words in the series?
  - What's the sentiment of the episodes across the seasons?
